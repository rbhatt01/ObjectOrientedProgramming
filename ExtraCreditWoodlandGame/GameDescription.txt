This is a cute woodland game inspired by the game snake.

The main character of this game is a deer and it can move with the cursors.

You can touch bunnies and have them follow you, but if the train of bunnies runs into eachother it is game over.

Foxes try to eat the bunnies following the deer, and turn them into carrots if they do. You can kill the foxes by pressing f.
If the fox eats all the bunnies then he will eat you and it will also be game over.
